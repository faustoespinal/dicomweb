			<u>D</u>igital <u>I</u>maging and <u>CO</u>mmunications in <u>M</u>edicine (DICOM) is the imaging standard for healthcare applications, founded in 1983 by
			the American College of Radiology (ACR) and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). It describes both the format and the transport method of 
			each image and how they are to be grouped (by series, by study, and by patient). For more information about DICOM, visit their <a href="http://medical.nema.org/">website</a>.
